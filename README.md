## Changes from the main template for succesful deployment

The original React template used to refer to a Google Sheet to update the site content. We have reverted to referring to *local content*, which is for our uses bith easier, more convenient and quicker. 

We have also changed the site from running on browser routing to hash routing in order to be able to run on GitHub pages.

This React page was set up to be deployed on GitHub Pages using [this guide.](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) In order to successfully be implemented, HashRouting was implemented in favor over BrowserRouting
